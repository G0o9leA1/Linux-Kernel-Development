### General Description
In this project we
  - Use kernel timers to schedule recurring events (e.g., thread wakeups) in the future.
  - Use kernel threads to perform deferrable work inside the kernel.
  - Create a simple monitoring framework that periodically captures basic information from kernelspace, using kernel timers and kernel threads to manage the frequency and context of such information gathering.
  - Verify and evaluate the operation of your monitoring framework through tracing techniques.
