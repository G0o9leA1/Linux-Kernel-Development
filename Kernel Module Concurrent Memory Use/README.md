### General Description
In this project we
  - Implement a kernel module that uses concurrent (and to the extent possible, parallel) processing to compute all the prime numbers up to a specified upper bound.
  - Again use basic multi-threaded synchronization and concurrency techniques, but in a more sophisticated configuration in which the threads will cooperate to complete a common task.
  - Manage kernel memory dynamically within the kernel module
